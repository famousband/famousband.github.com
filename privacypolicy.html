    <strong>How We Collect and Use Information</strong>
    <p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

    <i>Information you provide us directly:</i> 

    <p>We ask for certain information such as your name and email address if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>

    <i>Information we may receive from third parties:</i> 

    <p>We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, interacting with us through Twitter or Facebook from the The Band Famous Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to The Band Famous. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.</p>

    <i>Inviting a friend to use The Band Famous:</i> 

    <p>The Band Famous may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to invite third parties to the Service. If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite Friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to The Band Famous through the “Invite Friends” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.</p> 

    <i>Analytics information:</i>

    <p>We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>

    <i>Cookies information:</i> 

    <p>When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets The Band Famous enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

    <i>Commercial and marketing communications:</i> 

    <p>We use the information we collect or receive, such as your email address, to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions, and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related emails.</p> 


    <i>Use of certain service type information we collect about you:</i>

    <p>We use or may use cookies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (c) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (d) diagnose or fix technology problems.</p>

    <i>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:</i>

    <p>We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies (i) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “How We Collect and Use Information.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.</p>

    <p>We may also share certain information such as your cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you.

Opting out of these cookies will be effective not only on the Service, but on all websites with NAI certified advertising networks. However, these opt-outs will be ineffective on networks that are not NAI certified.</p>

    <p>Please note that an advertiser may ask The Band Famous to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, The Band Famous or our Partners determines the target audience and The Band Famous serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>
