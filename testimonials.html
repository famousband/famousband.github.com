I absolutely loved you, Norell and Zander, in that video that you did with the couples where Zander was finding these other women and making love to them, and you were in the background and you were, you were like this vision. What was the concept of that? I absolutely love that thing, and if that was a short film or movie, I'd watch that!</p>

      <blockquote style="color: black; text-shadow: none;">
        <p style="color: black; text-shadow: none;">Self-produced trip-hop group the Band Famous exist to uplift you, even if they sound a bit wacky when they do. They may not be self-actualized enough to dispense good advice, but their new single “Emotional Scatter” tries, dammit. Directed by TBF members Norell and Zander, the video tries to play motivational speaker, but when the band mixes in goofy lyrics and a mooning gnome toy, it’s hard to take them totally seriously. Which might be the point: Stop taking yourself so seriously and enjoy the jam.</p>

I saw a humanitarian part of them as well, these are genuine individuals! ...Wowww - that there is really interesting, that&rsquo;s an upgrade! That there is really something that&rsquo;s ingenious. You actually bring the folks great tunes, you actually have fantastic artistic ability when it comes to body painting, and there&rsquo;s a host of other things that you do. You guys were actually created through live-streaming, which is one of the biggest things and benefits that we have today in the entertainment industry.</p>

      <blockquote style="color: black; text-shadow: none;">
        <p style="color: black; text-shadow: none;">...The band famous, who somehow managed to form live on the internet..that&rsquo;s right&hellip;it&rsquo;s like they filmed their own birth&hellip;they made an interactive app by which they released their album. The more I read, the more surprised I was. They came together a couple of years ago in MN, they were all here in MN, and they all play music, they all make art, they also are all software developers, and actually some of the music from that initial jam session went on their debut EP <em>Last Words</em> which was released - wait for it - not on vinyl or via iTunes or any of the conventional ways of releasing music, but via an app - because they&rsquo;re all software developers, right? They made an interactive app by which they released their album..[The music?] It&rsquo;s dreamy, it&rsquo;s spacey. I think people will find a lot to enjoy, a lot of familiar, and ambient sounds. The whole thing is improvised by the way, all of their music to date has been entirely improvised.</p>

The band finished their initial release over a subsequent series of improv sessions&mdash;with Norell singing, Terry largely handling production duties, and all three members playing multiple instruments&mdash;and released the dreamy, synth-laden EP as a &lsquo;smart album&rsquo; in the form of an app. The app, which also features a game and videos, can now be downloaded for free on your iPhone or iPad (search &ldquo;Band Famous&rdquo; in the app store).</p>

        <p style="color: black; text-shadow: none;">Where can I even begin to do Norell and her band justice? I was lucky enough to meet her several years ago early on in her undergraduate career. Not only is she incredibly talented (and anyone working along with her is sure to prove the same!), beautiful inside and out, she is one of the most sincerely kind and thoughtful people I've had the opportunity to meet. The amount of positive energy and spirit she contributes to the world through her art, music, friendship, and kindness to all people after overcoming some of the most challenging obstacles life can dole out is nothing short of a genuine miracle. I truly believe and feel deeply that if she and The Band Famous can be backed to their goal, the world will become a better place. She's the real deal, guys! Down to earth, and as high as she can go, she'll never lose that. She's is THE example of what I wish everyone with the power and potential to influence our small world should follow. I have no doubt in my mind she and The Band Famous will make it! Thanks for all you have given so far!</p>

It is a great tool for entertainment, but also listening, just taking in the vibes, music, words, and feeling allows for expansion of your energy. Once into the melody and vibrations you can use these songs for a new experience in music. Choose a song that appeals to you then listen to it over a few days. Notice your feelings at the start and then on the third day. Def difference. Funky, funny, juicy - Famous. These people are movers and shakers. Hurry up and grab a shirttail because they are on the rise!!!</p>

        <p style="color: black; text-shadow: none;">I was lucky enough to meet this band last year and they are genuine artists on a mission. Wild, humble, and free. I love all of their songs with my favorite being “Who You Are” a subtle, yet haunting, melodic sound, which makes me think about where I’m at in my own life. That’s what music is supposed to do… evoke emotions. The Band Famous reminds me of Portishead, another band I love. With their eclectic sound and lyrics, this band will be around for a very long time… </p>

        <p style="color: black; text-shadow: none;"><b>The Band Famous – “Emotional Scatter” (PREMIERE)</b><br>
          Self-produced trip-hop group the Band Famous exist to uplift you, even if they sound a bit wacky when they do. They may not be self-actualized enough to dispense good advice, but their new single “Emotional Scatter” tries, dammit. Directed by TBF members Norell and Zander, the video tries to play motivational speaker, but when the band mixes in goofy lyrics and a mooning gnome toy, it’s hard to take them totally seriously. Which might be the point: Stop taking yourself so seriously and enjoy the jam.</p>
