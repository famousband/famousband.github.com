      	<blockquote>
			<p>Addictive. I particularly like the sensual song Ink and Feather, it reminds me of a after hours smokey bar. I have stayed away from games but Cycle of Destruction is crazy addictive. Natural elements take out or cancel the other - it is compelling playing competing symbols against each other.</p>
