          	TBF has hosted and produced various shows, including benefit concerts with the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank and the American Heart Association as beneficiaries. They also kicked off 2020 with their first ever benefit music festival produced with the collective efforts of an incredible team. "Live + Follow Your Dreams" - with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and My Friend's Place as beneficiaries - took place on Friday, January 17th, with the world's first ever Pokémon Go PvP ranked tournament for charity for an all ages event, and on Saturday, January 18th, 2020, with an 18+ event featuring body painting by TBF's Jacob Alexander aka Zander, stand-up comedy, and more. <br><br>Both nights featured some incredible live music acts including Nur-D, Dakotah Faye, Quaesar, Korynn OC, DRYX, and yours truly - The Band Famous - as well as three phenomenal DJs that were a treat for our eyes and ears: international producer and DJ, Gabriel Diggs; Power 106 / Young California / Beats 1 Radio DJ Tee Time; and rock drummer, electronic music producer and DJ Moon Channel. The next festival was set to take place on Friday, March 27th (all ages), and Saturday, March 28th (18+) featuring DJ Gabriel Diggs, DJ Tee Time - plus another great DJ, Astrolex, will be joining us from Minneapolis, MN. On top of that we will have live music performances and more special guests joining us. While the full festival must be post-ponded amid public health concerns, Zander and Norell will still be live streaming right here on bandfamous.com, on Twitch.tv/bandfamous, and through The Band Famous apps for iPhone and Android on 03/27/20 and 03/28/20. <br><br>Until further notice all TBF events will be live-stream only. Stay tuned and save the dates!</p>

This was the third time we had to reschedule our event and the third time really was a charm! We came together honoring and remembering our beloved friend Eyva Kid Cash, and successfully raised awareness and funds for <a href="https://give.cff.org/tribute/bandfamousforcff" target="_blank">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</a>, as well as for <a href="https://www.myfriendsplace.org" target="_blank">My Friend's Place</a>, helping homeless youth.

We had <a href="https://pkmnmasterholly.merchforall.com" target="_blank">PkmnMaster Holly</a> as our official MC and co-host for the entire weekend! We also had incredible DJs on both nights as well including <a href="https://www.gabrieldiggs.com" target="_blank">Gabriel Diggs</a>, who as a producer as well as DJ, has remixed highly acclaimed artists Idina Menzel, John Legend, Steve Aoki, Sarah McLachlan and Usher, and has DJed internationally in Ibiza, Brazil, Berlin, and more.
